Passionate about deeply understanding a customer’s business to then design and deliver impactful world class IT solutions that deliver real business change. Not on my own but together with a team of enthusiastic IT and business professionals; building the bridge between business and ICT. 

It is also fascinating how cloud technology, (open) data and communities allows us to create many new affordances for those who never had access to them before, how it pushes new instruments into the hands of each individual and how it creates new business opportunities. This fascination and the luck of real world experience, deliver a strong understanding of successful and unsuccessful models for cloud computing and (open) data.

RXJs Observables in Angular.  (this is a level 3 talk, working knowledge of Angular is required)
Client web applications are rich in events. Button clicks, keystrokes, and mouse moves are events. The data returned from an HTTP request arrives as an event. App components can send and receive messages through an event bus. Every page navigation is an event. Animations emit start and stop events. Events are everywhere.
RxJS Observables are the preferred way to manage events in Angular applications and many Angular APIs returns RxJS Observables.
This session covers the basics of RxJS observables for Angular developers. Youâ€™ll learn how to work with Angular observable APIs, which RxJS operators you should know, and how to write your own observable APIs.

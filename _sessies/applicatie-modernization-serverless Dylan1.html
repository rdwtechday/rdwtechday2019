In this session I will take you on a typical Application Modernization journey, 
from Lift and Shift to Cloud Optimized to App Modernized. I will cover various technologies such as containers (Kubernetes, ACI, Service Fabric) paas (webApps, CosmosDB) 
and serverless (Functions and Logic Apps) and tell which technology is most suitable in the journey to App Modernization.

I will support this session with demos and I will package a traditional application in a container and expand it
with serverless functions for automatically printing a digital driving license.

The follow-up sessions in this track will cover a deep dive in one of these technologies. 
So I'll cover the overview, pro and con's and show how to use the technology to get a good understanding about 
the principle capabilities.
